Computational Tools
===================

This text uses the Python 3 programming language, along with a standard set of
numerical and data visualization tools that are used widely in commercial
applications, scientific experiments, and open-source projects.
Python has recruited enthusiasts from many professions that use data to draw
conclusions. By learning the Python language, you will join a
million-person-strong community of software developers and data scientists.

**Getting Started.** 
A Python program can be executed by any computer, regardless of its
manufacturer or operating system, provided that support for the language is
installed. The current version of Python can be installed from [python.org][download1] although 
some prefer solutions with accompanying
libraries such as [Anaconda][download2]
distribution that packages together the Python 3 language interpreter, IPython
libraries, and the Jupyter notebook environment.

This text includes a complete introduction to all of these computational tools.
You will learn to write programs, generate images from data, and work with
real-world data sets that are published online.
